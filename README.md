<h2>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About IPThreatDetector</h2>

<p>During my studies in the TryHackMe SOC path, I encountered some challenges related to threat detection for specific IP addresses. To assist and optimize my time, I created a simple yet functional program to address these challenges. This program integrates with the VirusTotal API, which allows for 500 free queries per day.</p>

<h2>ü¶† About VirusTotal</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal</a> is a widely recognized platform that provides online threat scanning and analysis services. It aggregates information from various security sources, including antivirus and malware detection services, to assess whether a file or IP address is potentially malicious. It is a valuable tool for the cybersecurity community.</p>

<h2>üöÄ How to Use IPThreatDetector</h2>

<p>IPThreatDetector is easy to use. Simply provide an IP address as input, and the program will query the VirusTotal API to check the security of that IP. The program will display information about any reported threats associated with the provided IP. You can make informed decisions based on this information to enhance the security of your network.</p>
